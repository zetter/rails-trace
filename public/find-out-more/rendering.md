## Rendering

[ActionView](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_view_overview.html) is the part of Rails that helps build HTML pages (or other formats such as JSON or XML).

`ActionView` has to [find the corresponding template for the controller action](https://medium.com/rubyinside/disassembling-rails-template-rendering-1-51795f579577). If the view uses a shared layout `ActionView` finds it too.
